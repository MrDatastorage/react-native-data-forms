# React Native Data Forms

Create beautiful forms that submit data to redux, a graphql mutation, or an api in many different input types

This component makes data from any source editable using react native components. The data can be of many different types. If you have an app with many data properties that need to be edited, this can be a huge boilerplate reducer! For me it was, at least. When I introduced it it instantly removed >1000 LOC in my codebase. Then, I doubled the amount of pages with only a few dozen LOC added. Without this component that would be thousands of LOC.

This component is built for mutations of React Apollo GraphQL, but it can potentially also be used together with local databases, redux, or even state!

The goal of this function is to seperate semantics from data from implementation of showing editable and savable database data from any mutation, where data can have any type.
